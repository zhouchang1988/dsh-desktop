![DSH Desktop model provider settings](docs/images/model-provider-settings-v011.png)

<p align="center"><strong>Beyond official DeepSeek models, DSH Desktop supports mainstream third-party model providers—with more DSH-powered desktop experiences coming soon.</strong></p>

DSH Desktop packages the local DeepSeek Harness web experience as a desktop application. It launches a local Harness instance automatically, manages a random loopback port, persists profiles, plugins, and sessions, and opens the full interface as soon as Harness is ready. Project workspaces are added and managed entirely in the Harness interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DSH Desktop is currently an early preview and depends on the rapidly evolving `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.6`. macOS releases are code-signed and notarized by Apple; current installers are distributed through the official website.

## Download

Download DSH Desktop for macOS and Windows from the [official website](https://www.dshdesktop.com/#download).

Installed macOS and Windows builds check for updates automatically after startup and every six hours. Updates download in the background and prompt you to restart when they are ready. You can also choose **Check for Updates…** from the application menu.

## Why this project exists

DeepSeek Harness already provides a complete agent runtime and Web UI. DSH Desktop does not reimplement Harness; it supplies the host capabilities needed for a desktop product:

- Run without manually starting a CLI or managing local ports
- Create an application-owned Harness launch directory automatically at startup
- Add and manage project workspaces through Harness's built-in directory picker
- Manage the Harness child process, readiness checks, logs, and shutdown in one place
- Store profiles, plugins, and sessions outside the application installation directory so upgrades do not remove user data
- Provide packaging entry points for macOS and Windows

## Features

- Opens directly into Harness without an additional landing page
- Starts without an initial directory prompt by creating and reusing an internal launch directory
- Offers retry, log viewing, and exit actions when Harness fails to start
- Provides Harness menu actions for restarting the child process and viewing its log
- Gracefully terminates the Harness child process when the desktop app exits
- Listens only on a random `127.0.0.1` port for each launch
- Removes Node.js privileges from the renderer and enables `contextIsolation`, sandboxing, and navigation restrictions
- Uses the DSH brand logo consistently in the desktop window and Harness sidebar
- Imports and exports complete custom Agent presets as portable [`.dshpreset` packages](docs/preset-packages.md), with conflict checks and a trust warning before installation
- Includes a production DSH app icon in macOS ICNS and Windows ICO formats

## Friends

[dsh-market](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market) — the DeepSeek Harness plugin market: browse and search 900+ community plugins, preview screenshots, and install, update, enable or disable plugins, or switch themes with one click. Most plugins take effect instantly without a restart.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 22 or later
- npm
- macOS on Apple Silicon or Intel, or Windows x64

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataelement/dsh-desktop.git
cd dsh-desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm install` runs `patch-package` to reapply DSH Desktop's model-provider onboarding, preset package transfer, and sidebar branding, installs the brand asset, and then installs the Electron runtime.

### Quality checks

```bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

### Packaging

```bash
# Generate unsigned DMG and ZIP artifacts for the current Mac architecture
npm run package:mac

# Run each command on a Mac or CI runner with the matching architecture
npm run package:mac:arm64
npm run package:mac:x64

# Generate NSIS and Portable artifacts on a Windows x64 machine or runner
npm run package:win
```

Harness includes architecture-specific native modules. Dependencies must be reinstalled and built on the matching platform for macOS ARM64, macOS Intel, and Windows x64. The architecture-specific scripts validate the current `platform/arch` before packaging to prevent artifacts that appear successful but are missing native dependencies.

## Runtime architecture

```text
DSH Desktop (Electron Main)
├── Application-owned launch directory
├── Harness child-process lifecycle
├── Random loopback port and readiness checks
├── Native logging and recovery actions
└── Hardened BrowserWindow
     └── http://127.0.0.1:<random>  DeepSeek Harness Web UI

Electron userData
├── launch-root/
├── logs/harness.log
└── harness/
    ├── profiles/
    ├── sessions/
    └── Plugins and user data
```

Harness runs in a separate Electron Node child process. The `--expose-internals` permission required by Cordis HMR is granted only to that child process and never to the web renderer.

## Project structure

```text
src/main/             Electron main process, windows, and Harness lifecycle
src/shared/           Shared runtime types
patches/              Reproducible UI customizations for the pinned DSH version
scripts/              Brand-asset installation and target-platform packaging checks
test/                 Settings, runtime, security, and provider coverage tests
build/                Application icon assets
```

## Current validation status

- macOS Apple Silicon: development workflow, real Harness startup, DMG packaging, code signing, Apple notarization, and mounted artifact verified
- macOS Intel: packaging configuration and platform checks provided; runtime verification still requires an Intel Mac or runner
- Windows x64: NSIS/Portable configuration and platform checks provided; runtime verification still requires a Windows runner
- Windows ARM64: not currently supported
- Automatic updates: not yet integrated

## Upstream version and patches

The project currently pins `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.6`. The initial provider list and desktop preset-transfer surface are captured with [`patch-package`](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) under [`patches/`](patches/) rather than relying on untracked changes in `node_modules`.

When upgrading DSH:

1. Verify the upstream Settings, Credentials, and Provider Directory contracts.
2. Reapply or rewrite the customized onboarding interface.
3. Regenerate the patch.
4. Run regression checks against a real Harness startup and provider configuration flow.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Before submitting a change, run at least:

```bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Never include real API keys in issues, logs, screenshots, or test data.
